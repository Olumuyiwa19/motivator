# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the existing faith-based motivator chatbot from a localhost Streamlit application to a scalable, production-ready deployment on AWS Cloud. The solution will containerize the application, provide AWS alternatives to Streamlit hosting, implement load balancing for traffic management, and ensure high availability and security for users seeking Biblical encouragement and guidance.

## Requirements

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the chatbot application containerized and deployed using AWS services, so that I can ensure consistent deployment, scalability, and maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria 2

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL use Docker containers for consistent environment packaging
2. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL use AWS ECS or EKS for container orchestration
3. WHEN container instances fail THEN the system SHALL automatically replace them within 2 minutes
4. IF application updates are needed THEN the system SHALL support zero-downtime deployments
5. WHEN monitoring the deployment THEN the system SHALL provide container health checks and logging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle varying traffic loads efficiently, so that I can always access Biblical encouragement when needed without experiencing slowdowns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN traffic increases beyond baseline capacity THEN the system SHALL automatically provision additional container instances
2. WHEN traffic decreases THEN the system SHALL scale down resources to optimize costs
3. WHEN the load balancer receives requests THEN it SHALL distribute traffic evenly across healthy container instances
4. IF a container instance becomes unhealthy THEN the load balancer SHALL stop routing traffic to it within 30 seconds
5. WHEN users make requests THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-2 second response times under normal load

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to replace Streamlit with AWS Amplify for modern web frontend hosting, so that I can leverage AWS-native development tools and scalable hosting infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria 4

1. WHEN serving the web interface THEN the system SHALL use AWS Amplify for frontend hosting and deployment
2. WHEN users interact with the chatbot THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive web interface built with modern frameworks (React, Vue, or Angular)
3. WHEN handling static frontend assets THEN the system SHALL serve them through Amplify's built-in CDN capabilities
4. WHEN users access the application THEN the system SHALL provide HTTPS encryption automatically through Amplify
5. WHEN developing the frontend THEN the system SHALL use Amplify CLI for streamlined development and deployment workflows
6. WHEN users access the application THEN the system SHALL be available at the custom subdomain chatbot.muykol.com

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging for the deployed application, so that I can ensure reliability and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria 5

1. WHEN the application is running THEN the system SHALL send metrics to Amazon CloudWatch
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information to CloudWatch Logs
3. WHEN system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL trigger automated alerts
4. IF critical issues arise THEN the system SHALL notify administrators within 5 minutes
5. WHEN analyzing usage patterns THEN the system SHALL provide dashboards showing user activity and system performance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure authentication and authorization for the chatbot application, so that my interactions are protected and I can have a personalized experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria 6

1. WHEN accessing the application THEN the system SHALL require user authentication through AWS Cognito
2. WHEN users sign up THEN the system SHALL support email verification and secure password requirements
3. WHEN users are authenticated THEN the system SHALL provide JWT tokens for API access
4. IF users want social login THEN the system SHALL support federated identity providers (Google, Facebook, etc.)
5. WHEN managing user sessions THEN the system SHALL handle token refresh and secure logout

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the deployment to be secure and follow AWS best practices, so that user data and Biblical content are protected appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria 7

1. WHEN deploying infrastructure THEN the system SHALL use AWS VPC with private subnets for application containers
2. WHEN handling user requests THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all inputs through AppSync resolvers
3. WHEN storing configuration THEN the system SHALL use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or Secrets Manager for sensitive data
4. IF security vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL provide automated patching capabilities
5. WHEN accessing AWS services THEN the system SHALL use least-privilege IAM policies and Cognito-based authorization
6. WHEN protecting against web attacks THEN the system SHALL use AWS WAF with appropriate rule sets
7. WHEN detecting malicious traffic THEN AWS WAF SHALL block common attack patterns (SQL injection, XSS, DDoS)
8. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN AWS WAF SHALL log and optionally rate-limit requests from specific IP addresses
9. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL encrypt all data at rest using AWS KMS
10. WHEN transmitting data THEN the system SHALL use TLS 1.2+ for all communications
11. WHEN configuring network access THEN the system SHALL use restrictive Security Groups and NACLs with minimal required ports

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious administrator, I want the deployment to be cost-optimized while maintaining performance, so that we can provide the service sustainably.

#### Acceptance Criteria 8

1. WHEN traffic is low THEN the system SHALL scale down to minimum required resources
2. WHEN choosing instance types THEN the system SHALL use cost-effective options appropriate for the workload
3. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use appropriate storage classes for different data types
4. IF costs exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL provide alerts and recommendations
5. WHEN analyzing usage THEN the system SHALL provide cost breakdown and optimization suggestions

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a domain owner, I want the chatbot application to be accessible through my custom domain chatbot.muykol.com, so that users can easily find and access the service with a professional URL.

#### Acceptance Criteria 9

1. WHEN users navigate to chatbot.muykol.com THEN the system SHALL serve the chatbot application
2. WHEN configuring the domain THEN the system SHALL use AWS Route 53 for DNS management
3. WHEN setting up SSL THEN the system SHALL use AWS Certificate Manager for the custom domain
4. IF users access the application via HTTP THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect to HTTPS
